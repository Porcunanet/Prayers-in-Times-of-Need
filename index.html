            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <div class="intro">
                <p>We pray in order to communicate with God, to learn His will for us, and to offer ourselves to Him. God always answers prayer. He may not, however, answer the way we want Him to. While it is true that Jesus said if we ask anything in His name we will receive it, He also said, "Now is the confidence that we have in Him, that if we ask anything according to His will, He hears us." How do we learn to pray "according to His will"? At the beginning stages of prayer, using written prayers is like having training wheels on a bicycle. Using prayers that have been hallowed by time and use help us become rooted in the mind of the Church and the mind of Christ.</p>
                <p>These prayers are some of the most basic prayers of Orthodox Christians throughout the centuries. Take time over the words of the prayers. Say them carefully and reverently. Think about what the words mean. Allow them to sink into your soul. You will find that these prayers will help you communicate with God, and praying will give you great help in time of need.</p>

                <p>Lord Jesus Christ, remember Your Holy, Catholic, and Apostolic Church, which You redeemed with Your precious blood. Keep it strong and growing; Keep it in peace.</p>
                <p>Lord, have mercy and save our rulers and all who protect us, that we may have a tranquil life, free to pursue right belief, virtue and godly living.</p>
                <p>Lord, have mercy and save the holy patriarchs, bishops, and clergy of Your church. Through their prayers have mercy on me, a sinner, and save me.</p>
                <p>Lord, have mercy and save my family (parents, brothers, sisters, spouse, children and others) and my friends (names). Give them blessings now and salvation in the life to come.</p>
                <p><strong>Lord, have mercy and save:</strong></p>

                </ul>
                <p>Lord, remember all those who have fallen asleep in the hope of resurrection and eternal life. Forgive all their sins committed in knowledge or ignorance. Let them enjoy Your eternal blessings in the Light of Your presence; Grant them peace, refreshment, fellowship with Your saints, and life that never ends.</p>
                <p>Have mercy on us, for You are full of grace and love mankind. Amen.</p>

                <p>Lord, have mercy on us, for in You we trust. Do not be exceedingly angry with us, nor remember our iniquities. But look upon us now in Your compassion and deliver us from our enemies. For You are our God, and we are Your people; we are all the works of Your hands, and we call upon Your Name.</p>
                <p><strong>Now and ever and unto ages of ages. Amen</strong></p>
                <p>Open the gate of your compassion to us, O blessed Mother of God, and hoping in you may we not fail. Through you may we be delivered from adversity, for you are the salvation of the Christian race.</p>

Bless my dealings with all who surround me. Teach me to treat all that comes to me throughout the day with peace of soul and with firm conviction that Your will governs all. In all my deeds and words, guide my thoughts and feelings. In unforeseen events, let me not forget that all are sent by You. Teach me to act firmly and wisely, without embittering and embarrassing others. Give me strength to bear the fatigue of the coming day with all that it shall bring. Direct my will, teach me to pray.
